## 🎯 What's Left to Build

### 🚨 Critical (Must Have)

1. **Movie Detail Page** (`src/views/detail/index.ts`)
   - Full movie info from TMDB
   - Display personal rating/review if watched
   - Edit/delete actions

2. **Rating Component**
   - Interactive 5-star selector
   - Used when marking as watched

3. **Review Form Component**
   - Text area for personal review
   - Used with rating

### 🔶 Important (Should Have)

4. **Better Error Handling**
   - Toast notifications for success/errors
   - Graceful degradation

5. **User Statistics Dashboard**
   - Total movies, avg rating, favorites count

### 🟢 Nice to Have (Optional)

6. **Favorites System**
   - Toggle favorite on any movie
   - Filter to show only favorites

7. **Sort & Filter**
   - Sort by: date added, rating, title, year
   - Filter by: genre, year range, rating

8. **Responsive Design Polish**
   - Mobile menu
   - Touch-friendly buttons
   - Better mobile grid

## 📝 Key Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Vanilla TypeScript + Vite (no frameworks)
- **Backend**: Express + SQLite
- **State Management**: Custom Store class with observer pattern
- **Routing**: Client-side using History API
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

### Data Flow
1. **TMDB API** → Browse/Search movies (read-only)
2. **Custom Backend API** → User-specific data (watchlist, watched, ratings)
3. **Store** → Global state management
4. **Views** → Subscribe to store updates, trigger re-renders

### API Integration Pattern
```typescript
// Always include user ID header
headers: {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'x-user-id': 'Chas-n-Chill'
}

// Backend filters by user automatically
// Frontend filters by status (watchlist/watched)
```

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Button states** - Buttons show "Sparad!" but don't stay disabled after adding to watchlist
2. **No error messages to user** - Errors only log to console
3. **Duplicate movie handling** - Backend prevents, but no user feedback
4. **No loading indicators** - Most async operations happen silently
